# Flight Dynamics Assignment

TEST

## Deliverables
  - [] A calculation of the current mass and center of gravity location of the aircraft for each measurement point
  - [x] A completed mass and balance form.
  - [ ] The equilibrium equations for the horizontal, stationary and symmetric flight. Clearly state the assumptions used, and discuss (if possible) their effect on the results.
  - [x] Plots of C_L − C_D ,and C_L − α , labelled with aircraft configuration, Mach number range, and Reynolds number range.
  - [x] An analytical derivation of the eigenvalues of AS and Aa . State any simplifications you made to the EOM for the analytical derivation (if any).
  - [x] Provide the following results for the reference data, provided on Brightspace: CLα , Cmα , Cmδ , and the eigenvalues.
  - [ ] The eigenvalues for the A_S and A_a matrices as calculated using a computer and an explanation what these values tell you about the characteristics of the eigenmodes. Eigenvalues for matrices constructed based on the reference data on Brightspace and for the matrices using your flight test data.
  - [ ] Plots of the response of the relevant aircraft states of the numerical model to the different control inputs as demonstrated during the test flight (eigenmotions triggered by control input). Use a relevant time scale.
  - [ ] Plots of the response of the relevant aircraft states of the numerical model to a disturbance in of the states (eigenmotions demonstrated as an initial value problem).
  - [ ] Computer generated plots of the elevator trim curve and the elevator control force curve

## To Keep in Mind
  - All equations that are used, values of constants, SI units etc.
  - In general, discuss how the values of parameters compare to the theoretically expected values. Does each graph have the correct and expected slope and curvature? This is a form of verification.
  - To save space in the report, a list of symbols is not required. You can refer to the list of symbols in the AE3212-I Lecture Notes instead. However, if you use symbols that cannot be found in the Lecture Notes, these symbols should be listed or explained in your report.
  - All plots should be discussed in the text.
